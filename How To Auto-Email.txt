_Views_
The table NotificationListEmailGroups has a field ViewName. Enter the name of a view here. This view will fill the table
in the email. If the report includes Dealership and/or Dealership Group, call the columns DLR and GRP.
_Optional Filter View_
A second view with the same name with "Filter" appended can be created for formatting the report.
This view should have exactly one row with the exact same column names. 
Values can be:
ASC or DESC. Use these to sort this column ascending or descending.
SUM, AVG, or CNT. Use these to Sum, Average, or Count rows by Dealership or Group.

_Recipients_
Table NotificationListEmailGroups links ListNames to JobTitles.
Some JobTitles are Office Positions (JobTitles.OfficePosition = 1). People in these positions get emails for all locations.
Other positions only get emails for their Dealership, or if they have a Dealership Group (eg. Autostar USA) as their Home Dealership, the whole Group.

_Running_
Emails can be sent by schedule or by event.

For a simple schedule that runs once per day, you can set it up in the table NotificationListsTitles.
There is a trigger on IsDaily. When that is set to 1, a job is added to run on the days of the week 
and time entered into this table. The job's names start with "Email Job:"

When the schedule is more complicated or it needs to be run by event, you can still use the JobCodes recipients and the views, 
just don't enter IsDaily.

To add it to a trigger, call it like this:
    EXEC AutoEmailsSend 'ListName'
    Notice that this doesn't have any parameters, so it can't refer to just the INSERTED rows or anything.
